# User Stories

## Persona 1 (Marketing Agency Owner)

<img src='docs/users/Lauren.png' width="300">

### Lauren

Lauren is a 39 year old founder / sole director of a boutique marketing agency. She began working in the marketing industry 18 years ago, originally focusing on Events / PR and communications but has had a variety of roles since. While working on a breast cancer campaign for a hospital, Lauren discovered the importance of branding and developed a passion for helping people get their message heard, one of the main reasons she started her own agency 4 years ago. Lauren goes to galleries on the weekend (if she has the time) and lives in Melbourne in her 3 bedroom house with her partner and their 2 year old.

### Job Description

As her agency has grown, Lauren has spent less time working directly with clients and more time managing her team and developing new business opportunities. Although she's able to delegate many responsibilities, she still has a huge workload having to manage business development, hiring and overall operational management. Lauren believes it is her responsibility to make sure her clients are happy, while also ensuring her staff are comfortable and effective in their roles.

### Professional Goals

Lauren has worked incredibly hard to build her agency, and is professionally satisfied. Over the next decade she hopes to build her team by a few more employees and gradually offload more and more of her responsibilities onto capable leaders within her team. She hopes that by offloading some of her current work she will have time to work more closely with clients again and inject some of her own creativity back into projects. Lauren loves her team and wants to nurture their growth the best she can.

### Motivators

Lauren is proud to be an independent business owner, and enjoys building relationships in her team - the biggest motivator for her is to have a strong team to which she feels connected.

### Challenges

Although she is extremely passionate about her team and her work, Lauren sometimes feels that her responsibilities as the owner of an agency consumes more of her time than she would like. She has had clients mention that although her team is fantastic, they would like to spend more time with Lauren personally, and see more of her own creative input. Lauren's biggest challenge is communicating how important marketing is for growing businesses; she has discovered that marketing is often the first expense to be cut from a tight budget, but believes that this shouldn't always be the case.
