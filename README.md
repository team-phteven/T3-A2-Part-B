# Libraries used

The following libraries were used to create the app.

## Node

### What is Node?

Node is a Javascript runtime built based on Chrome's V8 engine. Javascript could originally only be run in the browser, but Node allows Javascript to be run in servers.

Node was used to run the backend of the application. It serves as an API, taking incoming requests and responding with appropriate data/actions.

## Express

### What is Express?

Express is a flexible framework for building web applications which is imported into the Node backend to build out RESTful APIs.

### How is Express used in the project?

Express was used to create the API that handled all incoming requests from the front end.The server instance was created using express, as well as all middleware functions that executed actions in between requests and responses.

## React

### What is React?

React is a Javascript library used for building component-based and stateful front ends.

### How was React used in the project?

React was used to build all front end components in the app including sidebars, modals, avatars, forms and so forth. Context providers were key in keeping the front end in sync with the backend.

## MongoDB

### How was Dotenv used in the app?

Dotenv was used to load environment variables and secrets that should only ever be known by the backend.

## Socket.io

### What is socket.io?

Socket.io is a library used to handle web-sockets in the Node backend.

### How was socket.io used in the project?

## Socket.io-client

### What is socket.io-client?

Socket.io is a library used to handle web-sockets in the front-end.

### How was socket.io-client used in the project?

## Validator

### What is Validator?

Validator is a Javascript library used to provide validation of user input.

### How was Validator used in the project?

## React-bootstrap

### What is React-bootstrap?

React-bootstrap is a library which gives access to React-components styled using bootstrap.

### How was React-bootstrap used in the project?

React-bootstrap was used to create many of the front-end components such as buttons, modals and forms, and was also used to lay out the structure of the front-end using bootstrap's grid system.

## Axios

Axios is a library that is used to make HTTP requests.

### How was Axios used in the project?

Axios was used to make requests from the front-end. The requests utilised configuration, headers and promise-based syntax.

## Jest

### What is Jest?

Jest is a testing framework for Javascript.

### How was Jest used in the project?

Jest was used to create both unit and integration tests for various functions within the app.

## Luxon
